An E-KYC system using blockchain technology streamlines the customer identity verification process by leveraging the decentralized and secure nature of blockchain. Customers submit their documents, which are encrypted and hashed, with the hash stored on the blockchain to ensure data integrity. Smart contracts automate the verification process by KYC providers, who update the blockchain with the verification status. Customers can control access to their KYC data, allowing multiple financial institutions to reuse verified information without redundancy. This system enhances security, efficiency, user privacy, and regulatory compliance through transparent and immutable records.
